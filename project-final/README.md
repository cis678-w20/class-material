# Final Project

For this class, you have a few options to satisfy your final project requirement.

## Project Requirements (All Options)
Regardless of which option you choose, you must create a short 5 minute recorded
presentation and post it publicly on Piazza to the class by the scheduled
start of the final exam time (April 21 @ 6:00pm).  Make sure
the post clearly indicates the project authors. This does not need to include
a video of you, but it should include at the very least your voice and some slides
illustrating what you did.  If you are on a mac, this can be done with the native
screen capture (just make sure you have it set to record the mic too).  An alternative
for other OSs is to use Zoom.  You can make a zoom meeting with only you in it, and
then screen share your desktop and record the meeting (this is how I record my lectures).

Piazza has an option to insert video, so you should be able to post the video directly
there.  If not, let me know and I will create a different shared space to upload.

As with the past projects, you are free to do this individually or with a partner.

## Option 1:  Reinforcement Learning Project
This is a preset project like the other ones to implement RL for a tic-tac-toe game.
See the [project description](project-final/final-project-reinforcement-option.pdf)
for more details.  If you go this route, your presentation should focus on
anything you found particularly interesting, neat visualizations, code aspects.

## Option 2:  Project of Your Choice
If you have something you would like to impelement, you may do a project of your choice.
This must go beyond something we did earlier in the previous projects (so simply 
grabbing an additional UCI dataset and running the same code won't count).  
Some things that may meet this requirement:

* Taking a significantly different dataset and using one of the techniques
  from previous projects or one we did not implement to solve.
  This could be a dataset you are just interested in or something you work on for work
  (but you must be able to present your results to the class).
* Extending a project by adding new features or
  going beyond what we did in a project, for instance delving into a more advanced
  package like XGBoost and showing it's performance compared to default
  sklearn for a different dataset.   Or doing a project involving deep learning
  with keras/tensorflow on something other than MNIST.  If you had been thinking
  there was one project you wished you could have done additional further exploration
  with, now is your chance.
* Implementing something we did not have implement in a project (such as recommender
  systems, etc).

## Option 3:  Presentation of Advanced Topic
This option will allow you to choose any topic that we did not have time to cover
or choose to go deeper into a topic than our time permitted and give an executive
summary of the topic designed for people with relevant ML knowledge, but not 
specific knowledge of the topic.  You should research the topic using textbooks,
journals, reliable websites/videos.  Examples of topics that could be interesting:

* SVMs
* Evolutionary algorithms
* Deep reinforcement Learning
* Autoencoders
* Autoregressive models (time series)
* GANs (generative adversarial networks)
* Pretrained NNs
* Plenty of other advanced topics -- ask if you are not sure
